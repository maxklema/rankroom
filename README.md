## Background

The Collaborative Decision Maker application was developed to address the challenges teams face when making decisions collectively. Traditional decision-making processes can be time-consuming and may not effectively incorporate diverse perspectives. This application aims to streamline the process by providing a structured workflow that encourages collaboration and transparency.

I had a [conversation with herbie](https://ai.bluehive.com/session/uCGXm4b6hdScWkcSv#FXlaNhMmLT5ksLHi2xZF9KbQzjDxMt8uZLTHjJLkvTk) to get it kicked off.
